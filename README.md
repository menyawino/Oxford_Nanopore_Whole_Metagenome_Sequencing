# Introduction to Long Read Sequencing in Metagenomics

Long read sequencing has revolutionized the field of metagenomics by enabling more accurate and comprehensive analysis of complex microbial communities. This technology allows for the sequencing of DNA fragments that are much longer than traditional short-read methods, typically ranging from several kilobases to over a megabase in length. The increased read length provides numerous advantages in metagenomic studies, including improved genome assembly, better resolution of repetitive regions, and enhanced ability to link genetic elements across long distances.

## Basic Knowledge

- Definition and advantages of long read sequencing: Long read sequencing refers to technologies that can sequence DNA fragments of several kilobases or more in a single read. The primary advantages include improved genome assembly, better resolution of repetitive regions, and the ability to detect structural variants more accurately.
- Comparison with short read sequencing technologies: While short read technologies (e.g., Illumina) offer high throughput and low error rates, they struggle with repetitive regions and structural variants. Long reads can span these challenging regions, providing a more complete picture of genomic structure.
- Key applications in metagenomics: Long read sequencing is particularly valuable in metagenomics for assembling complete or near-complete genomes from complex communities, identifying mobile genetic elements, and resolving strain-level variations within species.

## Long Read Sequencing Technologies

- Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) SMRT sequencing: This technology uses a single DNA polymerase molecule to sequence a single strand of DNA. It produces high-quality, long reads with an average length of 10-30 kb, and can achieve read lengths of up to 100 kb.
- Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing: ONT uses nanopores to sequence DNA by measuring changes in electrical current as DNA passes through the pore. It can produce ultra-long reads (>1 Mb) and allows for real-time sequencing and analysis.
- PacBio typically offers higher accuracy but shorter read lengths compared to ONT. ONT provides longer reads and real-time sequencing capabilities but traditionally has higher error rates. Both platforms continue to improve in terms of accuracy and read length.

## Sample Preparation for Long Read Metagenomics

- DNA extraction and quality control: High molecular weight DNA extraction is crucial for long read sequencing. Methods such as phenol-chloroform extraction or specialized kits designed for long-read sequencing are commonly used. Quality control steps include checking DNA integrity using gel electrophoresis and assessing purity with spectrophotometry.
- Library preparation methods for PacBio and ONT: For PacBio, SMRTbell libraries are prepared by ligating hairpin adapters to both ends of DNA fragments. For ONT, library preparation involves attaching sequencing adapters to DNA ends. Both methods aim to minimize DNA shearing to preserve long fragments.
- Considerations for metagenomic samples: Metagenomic samples often contain DNA from various organisms in different abundances. Care must be taken to avoid bias towards certain species during extraction and library preparation. Size selection steps may be included to enrich for longer fragments.

## Sequencing Protocols and Run Setup

- PacBio sequencing protocols for metagenomics: PacBio offers various sequencing modes, including Continuous Long Read (CLR) and High-Fidelity (HiFi) modes. For metagenomics, HiFi reads are often preferred due to their high accuracy.
- ONT sequencing protocols for metagenomics: ONT offers different flow cell types and sequencing kits. For metagenomics, high-capacity flow cells (e.g., PromethION) are often used to achieve sufficient coverage of complex communities.
- Optimizing run parameters for metagenomic samples: Parameters such as read length, sequencing time, and basecalling models can be optimized based on the complexity of the metagenomic sample and the specific research questions.

# Data Analysis Guidelines

### 1. **Raw Data Acquisition from the Sequencer**

**Description:**

- After sequencing on platforms like Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or PacBio, the initial output is raw signal data. This data contains the electrical signals (ONT) or fluorescence intensity traces (PacBio) corresponding to the nucleotide sequences.

**Tools:**

- **ONT:** Basecalling is performed using Guppy or Dorado.
- **PacBio:** The SMRT Link software processes the raw data into sequences.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

- **Basecalling (ONT):** Guppy or Dorado transforms the raw electrical signals from the nanopores into nucleotide sequences using neural networks (CNNs). These models are trained on vast datasets to recognize patterns in the electrical signals that correspond to each nucleotide.
    - **Input:** Raw signal data from the sequencer (often in `.fast5` format).
    - **Output:** Basecalled sequences in FASTQ format, which includes the nucleotide sequences and associated quality scores.
- **PacBio Basecalling:** The SMRT Link software processes the real-time fluorescence signals captured during sequencing into nucleotide sequences. It uses algorithms that model the kinetics of the DNA polymerase to decode the sequence from the fluorescent pulses.
    - **Input:** Raw `.bax.h5` or `.bam` files containing pulse signals.
    - **Output:** Basecalled sequences in FASTQ format or circular consensus sequences (CCS) in FASTQ format with high accuracy.

**Rationale:**

- Basecalling is the first step to convert raw sequencing data into usable sequence reads. The accuracy of this step is crucial, as errors introduced here will propagate through subsequent analyses.

### 2. **Quality Control of Raw Reads**

**Description:**

- After basecalling, the sequence reads undergo quality control to assess and filter out low-quality reads and any adapters or barcodes that may have been attached during library preparation.

**Tools:**

- **NanoPlot/NanoQC:** Visualizes the quality of ONT reads.
- **Filtlong:** Filters long reads by quality and length for ONT.
- **PacBio QC:** SMRT Link also provides tools for read quality assessment.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

- **NanoPlot/NanoQC:** These tools parse the FASTQ files to generate visual reports of read length distributions, quality scores, and GC content. They use Python libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualization.
    - **Input:** FASTQ files.
    - **Output:** Graphical reports (e.g., PDFs, PNGs) and summary statistics.
- **Filtlong:** This tool filters reads by selecting the longest and highest-quality reads based on user-defined criteria. It uses sliding window techniques to assess read quality across the sequence.
    - **Input:** FASTQ files.
    - **Output:** Filtered FASTQ files containing high-quality, long reads.

**Rationale:**

- Quality control ensures that only the best data is used in subsequent steps, improving the reliability of downstream analyses. It removes low-quality reads that could lead to errors in assembly or misclassification in taxonomic analysis.

### 3. **De Novo Assembly**

**Description:**

- In this step, the filtered high-quality reads are assembled into contiguous sequences (contigs). Assembly reconstructs the original genomes present in the metagenomic sample.

**Tools:**

- **ONT:** Flye, Canu, or Shasta.
- **PacBio:** Canu, Flye, or HiCanu for HiFi reads.
- **Hybrid assemblies:** SPAdes in hybrid mode (short + long reads) or Unicycler.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

- **Flye:** Flye uses an overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) algorithm optimized for long reads. It starts by finding overlaps between all pairs of reads (using data structures like hash tables for efficient lookups). Next, it builds a layout graph where nodes represent reads and edges represent overlaps. Finally, it resolves the graph into contigs through a consensus step.
    - **Input:** FASTQ files of long reads.
    - **Output:** Assembled contigs in FASTA format.
- **Canu:** Canu improves on the OLC approach by incorporating error correction. It first corrects the reads by identifying and fixing common sequencing errors. Then, it constructs an overlap graph and simplifies it to generate the final assembly.
    - **Input:** FASTQ files of long reads.
    - **Output:** Assembled contigs in FASTA format.
- **Shasta:** Shasta uses a unique approach based on a "shingling" method, where reads are split into smaller k-mers, and overlaps are identified based on these k-mers. Itâ€™s highly optimized for speed and memory usage.
    - **Input:** FASTQ files of long reads.
    - **Output:** Assembled contigs in FASTA format.

**Rationale:**

- Assembly is critical for reconstructing the genomes of the organisms present in the sample. Long reads are advantageous as they span repetitive regions and complex genomic structures that short reads cannot resolve. Tools like Flye and Canu are designed to handle the error-prone nature of long reads while producing high-quality assemblies.

### 4. **Polishing the Assembly**

**Description:**

- Polishing corrects errors in the assembled contigs by aligning the original reads back to the assembly and refining the consensus sequence.

**Tools:**

- **ONT:** Medaka, Racon.
- **PacBio:** Arrow (for CCS reads), Racon.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

- **Racon:** Racon performs multiple rounds of read alignment and consensus correction. It uses the `minimap2` aligner to map reads to the assembled contigs, then corrects the contigs by calculating a consensus sequence from the aligned reads.
    - **Input:** Assembled contigs (FASTA), original reads (FASTQ).
    - **Output:** Polished contigs in FASTA format.
- **Medaka:** Medaka focuses on polishing ONT assemblies by leveraging neural networks. It refines the consensus sequence based on the likelihood of different base calls given the alignment of multiple reads.
    - **Input:** Assembled contigs (FASTA), original reads (FASTQ).
    - **Output:** Polished contigs in FASTA format.

**Rationale:**

- Polishing is essential to reduce the error rate in the final assembly, especially given the higher error rates associated with long-read sequencing. It ensures that the consensus sequence more accurately reflects the true biological sequences present in the sample.

### 5. **Taxonomic Classification**

**Description:**

- This step involves assigning taxonomy to the contigs or reads, identifying the species or higher-level taxa present in the metagenomic sample.

**Tools:**

- **Kraken2:** A taxonomic classification tool that assigns taxonomy based on exact k-mer matches.
- **Centrifuge:** Uses a Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)-based approach to classify reads.
- **MetaPhlAn3:** Uses marker genes for species-level resolution.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

- **Kraken2:** Kraken2 builds a database of k-mers from known reference genomes. Each k-mer is associated with a taxon in a classification tree. During classification, Kraken2 breaks down the reads into k-mers and matches them against the database. The tool then assigns the read to the taxon with the most k-mer matches.
    - **Input:** Reads or contigs in FASTA/FASTQ format.
    - **Output:** Taxonomic assignments with confidence scores.
- **Centrifuge:** Centrifuge compresses reference genomes using BWT and FM-index, which allows efficient storage and rapid query. During classification, it aligns reads to the compressed reference, identifying the most likely taxonomic assignment.
    - **Input:** Reads or contigs in FASTA/FASTQ format.
    - **Output:** Taxonomic classifications and confidence scores.

**Rationale:**

- Accurate taxonomic classification helps elucidate the composition of the microbial community. Tools like Kraken2 and Centrifuge are optimized for speed and accuracy, making them suitable for large metagenomic datasets.

### 6. **Binning of Contigs**

**Description:**

- Binning groups contigs that likely belong to the same genome, reconstructing metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).

**Tools:**

- **MetaBAT2:** A probabilistic approach to binning based on sequence composition and read coverage.
- **MaxBin2:** Uses an expectation-maximization algorithm to assign contigs to bins based on similar coverage and GC content.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

- **MetaBAT2:** MetaBAT2 calculates the tetranucleotide frequency of contigs and uses a Gaussian mixture model to group contigs with similar sequence composition. It also uses coverage information to refine binning, assuming that contigs from the same organism will have similar coverage across samples.
    - **Input:** Assembled contigs in FASTA format, read coverage data.
    - **Output:** Binned contigs (MAGs) in separate FASTA files.
- **MaxBin2:** MaxBin2 first calculates the probability of each contig belonging to different bins based on sequence composition and coverage. It iteratively refines these probabilities to maximize the likelihood that contigs are correctly binned.
    - **Input:** Assembled contigs in FASTA format, read coverage data.
    - **Output:** Binned contigs (MAGs) in separate FASTA files.

**Rationale:**

- Binning is crucial for reconstructing the genomes of individual species or strains from a metagenomic sample. Accurate binning allows for more detailed downstream analyses, such as functional annotation and comparative genomics.

### 7. **Functional Annotation**

**Description:**

- Functional annotation involves predicting the functions of genes present in the assembled contigs or MAGs, linking sequences to biological functions.

**Tools:**

- **Prokka:** Annotates bacterial genomes by predicting genes, coding sequences (CDS), and other features.
- **EggNOG-mapper:** Annotates sequences by mapping them to orthologous groups and functional categories.
- **GhostKOALA:** Annotates genes by assigning them to KEGG Orthology (KO) terms.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

- **Prokka:** Prokka uses a series of embedded tools (e.g., `Prodigal` for gene prediction, `BLAST` for functional annotation) to predict and annotate coding sequences, tRNAs, rRNAs, and other genomic features. It assigns functions based on similarity to known proteins and functional databases.
    - **Input:** Assembled contigs or MAGs in FASTA format.
    - **Output:** Annotated genomes in GFF and GBK formats, with associated protein sequences.
- **EggNOG-mapper:** This tool aligns predicted protein sequences against the EggNOG database, which contains clusters of orthologous groups. It uses a HMM-based approach to identify the best matching orthologs and assigns functional annotations based on the database's functional categories.
    - **Input:** Protein sequences in FASTA format.
    - **Output:** Annotated sequences with functional categories and GO terms.

**Rationale:**

- Functional annotation provides insights into the metabolic pathways, virulence factors, and other biological functions present in the metagenomic sample. Tools like Prokka and EggNOG-mapper offer comprehensive and automated approaches to annotating large datasets.

### 8. **Data Integration and Visualization**

**Description:**

- Integrating taxonomic and functional data provides a holistic view of the microbial ecosystem. Visualization tools help interpret the complex data generated from metagenomic studies.

**Tools:**

- **Krona:** Interactive visualization of taxonomic abundance.
- **Anviâ€™o:** A platform for visualizing contigs, bins, and functional data.
- **iTOL:** Visualization of phylogenetic trees with associated metadata.

**How It Works (CS Level):**

    - **Input:** Taxonomic classification data (e.g., Kraken2 output).
    - **Output:** HTML files with interactive visualizations.
- **Anviâ€™o:** Anviâ€™o integrates multiple types of data (e.g., taxonomic, functional, and coverage data) and provides interactive visualizations of contigs, bins, and functional annotations. It uses a SQLite database to store and query large datasets efficiently and `D3.js` for dynamic visualizations.
    - **Input:** Contigs in FASTA format, binning results, and annotation data.
    - **Output:** Interactive visualizations and summary reports.

**Rationale:**

- Visualization tools help make sense of complex metagenomic data, allowing researchers to explore relationships between taxa, functions, and environmental factors. Krona, Anviâ€™o, and similar tools provide interactive and flexible ways to analyze and present data.
